## Description
```
This is a portfolio site for my freelance writing business.
I have included a bio, some of my writing work and a testimonials page.

```



## Custom CSS Classes
```
The class(es) I created are:

1. I created several ID selectors for the creation of my "random testimonial" page, including #quoteContainer, #quoteButton, #buttonContainer among others in
the "Testimonial Styles" section of my CSS file. These were done to help me style the button and have enough room for my quote to
Each class was meant to aid in the design of the random quote generator. I wanted the end user to click the button, "Hit me with a quote," to have a random quote appear.

2. I also included several element styles for HTML tags, including h1, h2, and p, among others.

```



## Custom JavaScript Functions
```
The javascript functions I created are:

1. I used jQuery to create a "random testimonial generator." It includes fade-in and fade-out animation. I included robust notes in my code for each action.

```
