<h1>I've worked with a lot of people. Most of them still like me.</h1>
<h2>But don't take my word for it – they have mouths</h2>

<p>Kim was my go to gal on staff. I could quite literally do a drive by her desk, spew some loosely formed notions of all the things I wanted a single 6-word headline to do and she would effortlessly reply with a clever, quick-witted zinger that would have me pulling my finger guns out the hostler before I even had the chance to sit down. She is thoughtful in her approach, spunky in her style and a continuous student of her craft. Kim is tremendously talented. Period.
P.S. Copywriters love punctuation jokes.</p>

<p>Kim Huston has been the best work-proximity-associate that I've ever had the pleasure of working with creatively. With a laugh heard 'round the world (like literally, she is l-o-u-d), you can at least know where she is if you want to avoid her. And if you don't hear her, you know she's getting shit done and you best not disturb her or she'll come at you like a wolverine. But like, she's still cute even with her teeth bared... awwwww! Even though we've both moved on to legitimately greener pastures, I still hit her up whenever I need a copy partner because she is a copy pro and is a great collaborator. Hopfully she proofed this because I told her to. </p>
<strong>Cara Smith Bezuska, graphic designer, video game designer</strong>

<p>Five stars. Would hire</p>
<strong>Jaime Endick, content and social media strategist, brevity believer</strong>

<p>Kim’s social media outreach work generated so much traffic to my website about Shaq that it crashed. More than once. Influential in Canadian basketblogger circles.</p>
