She is thoughtful in her approach, spunky in her style and a continuous student of her craft. Kim is tremendously talented. Period. P.S. Copywriters love punctuation jokes.",

With a laugh heard 'round the world (like literally, she is l-o-u-d), you can at least know where she is if you want to avoid her. And if you don't hear her, you know she's getting shit done and you best not disturb her or she'll come at you like a wolverine. But like, she's still cute even with her teeth bared... awwwww! Even though we've both moved on to legitimately greener pastures, I still hit her up whenever I need a copy partner because she is a copy pro and is a great collaborator. Hopfully she proofed this because I told her to.",
