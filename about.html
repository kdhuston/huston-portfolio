<p>I'm a lot like Abraham Lincoln â€“ born in Kentucky, raised in Indiana. I have a B.A. in journalism from Indiana University - Bloomington (Go Hoosiers!) and a MLIS with a focus in special libraries from Wayne State University in Detroit, Mich. My career has comprised of many different roles all focused on creative communications, but my heart is in my community. I am a long-time volunteer and board member of <a href="http://www.adelanteky.org/">Adelante Hispanic Achievers</a>, a non-profit organization devoted to empowering our Hispanic youth by engaging students and their parents in long-term academic, mentoring, and personal enrichment programs. I am also the Mideast Regional advisor for the Gates Millennium Scholars Alumni Association. I spend my time in Louisville, Ky., with my partner, Jason, and my adorable cat trio, Diego, Paco, and Ginny.</p>
